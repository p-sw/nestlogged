# NestJS Logging Decorators

This package provides some decorations to make NestJS logging simpler.  
It only uses Logger provided by @nestjs/common package and some dependencies required for nestjs.

This package wraps [`nestlogged`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nestlogged), but with additional decorator to fix bugs with Fastify.

## Installation

```sh
npm install nestlogged-fastify
```

or

yarn add nestlogged-fastify
```
