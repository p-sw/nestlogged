- `nestlogged` is a **main package**, and contains all base functionalities.
- `nestlogged-fastify` is a **patched version** for `nestlogged`.

    - `nestlogged-fastify` **builds** all the decorators _again_ with **patched version of overrideBuild**
- All changes should be done in `nestlogged` package.
  - If changed code is also in `nestlogged-fastify` as patched version, the change should be **copied** to `nestlogged-fastify` package.
